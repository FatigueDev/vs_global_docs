# Welcome to VSGlobal!

A nifty networking solution for lazy people. Clientside only, lets you send and receive data to anyone on the VSGlobal network.
So someone in one singleplayer world can receive a packet from someone in another singleplayer world.

Cool for stuff like:
- A global chat
- Sending items across servers / worlds
- A global marketplace
- Broadcast to everyone that you were eaten by a wolf again
